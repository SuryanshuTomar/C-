// => What are pointers ?
// - Pointers are containers used to store values just like variable. The only difference is that pointers are used to store a memory location
// - Pointers can only be declared the same data type it has been referenced to. Like - an integer pointer can only points to an integer value.
// - We can also deference a pointer to get the value that the pointer memory address is holding and change its value also. And this is called dereferencing of a pointer.
// - It is must for Pointers to assign a value which points to a similar data type memory address otherwise pointers can not be used for dereferencing.
