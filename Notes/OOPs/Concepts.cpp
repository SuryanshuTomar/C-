// => What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP) ?
// - Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.
// - The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as truly object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk is considered as the first truly object-oriented programming language.

// -> OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System) -
// - Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
// 1. Object
// 2. Class
// 3. Inheritance
// 4. Polymorphism
// 5. Abstraction
// 6. Encapsulation

// -> Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language -
// 1. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as the project size grows.
// 2. OOPs provide data hiding whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language a global data can be accessed from anywhere.
// 3. OOPs provide ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.
